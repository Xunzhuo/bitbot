The Prowox is a kube prow style bot helps manage your issues and PRs via GitHub Action, which is easy-to-use and lightweight.

## Installation

Take this as an example to use this bot: [examples](./examples/prowox.yaml). You should edit it firstly to set up maintainers, approvers and reviewers of your project.

We support read roles from [OWNERS](https://github.com/Xunzhuo/prowox/blob/main/OWNERS) file, follow k8s community [OWNERS Rules](https://go.k8s.io/owners):

``` yaml
# See the OWNERS docs at https://go.k8s.io/owners

maintainers:
  - Xunzhuo

approvers:
  - Xunzhuo

reviewers:
  - Xunzhuo

```

We also support define Roles in env (Not recommended, we will prioritize reading roles from OWNERS if you defined it.):

```yaml
env:
  REVIEWERS: |-
    Reviewer1
    Reviewer2
  APPROVERS: |-
    Approver1
    Approver2
  MAINTAINERS: |-
    Maintainer1
    Maintainer2
```

And then you can manage the commands which different roles can access and use in env:

```yaml
  # This commands is for anyone who can use it
  COMMON_PLUGINS: |-
    assign
    unassign
    kind
    remove-kind
    cc
    uncc
  # This commands is for author of issue or PR
  AUTHOR_PLUGINS: |-
    retest
  # This commands is for organization member or repository member
  MEMBERS_PLUGINS: |-
    good-first-issue
    help-wanted
    close
    reopen
  # This commands is for in the REVIEWERS environment variable
  REVIEWERS_PLUGINS: |-
    area
    remove-area
    lgtm
    hold
    retitle
  # This commands is for in the APPROVERS environment variable
  APPROVERS_PLUGINS: |-
    merge
    approve
    rebase
  # This commands is for in the MAINTAINERS environment variable
  MAINTAINERS_PLUGINS: |-
    milestone
    remove-milestone
    priority
    remove-priority
```

Then you can just copy it into `.github/workflows/` and it should work now.
